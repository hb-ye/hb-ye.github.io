Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am currently a **Research Assistant Professor** in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

I have a broad spectrum of research interest in transport-related problems, with an aim to improve the system efficiency and sustainability to benefit both the travellers and the operators.  I have utilized optimisation and control theory in the modelling and analysis of rail and road systems as well as their operation, management and control.

### Vacancies for PhD and Postdoc

- Funded **PhD positions** are available to work on topics related to the management, operation and control of autonomous vehicles. Candicates with any major are welcomed to apply (incluiding but not limited to Maths, Control, Operations Research, Transportation, etc.), but are expected to have a solid background in mathematical modelling and analysis.

- **Postdoc positions** are available to work on topics related to the eco-driving of autonomous vehicles.

### Research Interest

- Transportation network modeling, management and optimization

- Day-to-day traffic flow dynamics

- Railway operation and control

- Eco-driving (trains and cars)
