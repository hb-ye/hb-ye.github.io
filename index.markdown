Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am currently a **Research Assistant Professor** in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

I have a broad spectrum of research interest in transport-related problems, with an aim to improve the system efficiency and sustainability to benefit both the travellers and the operators.  I have utilized optimisation and control theory in the modelling and analysis of rail and road systems as well as their operation, management and control.

### Vacancies for PhD and Postdoc

- Funded **PhD positions** are available to work on topics related to the application of optimization techniques on transportation problems, including but not related to management, operation and control of autonomous vehicles.

  - Candicates with any background are welcomed to apply (including but not limited to Maths, Control, Operations Research, and Transportation), but are expected to have a solid background in mathematical modelling/analysis/optimization.

  - PhD scholarship oppotunities include the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship, PolyU Presidential PhD Fellowship, and PolyU Research Postgraduate Scholarship. Details can be find at [this webpage (PolyU Graduate School](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/gs/prospective-students/fellowship-scholarship-schemes/)

- **Postdoc positions** are available.

- If you are interested, please contact me via email.
