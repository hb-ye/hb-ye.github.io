Welcome to my personal webpage!

<!-- I am currently a **Research Assistant Professor** in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. -->

I have a broad spectrum of research interest in transport-related problems, with an aim to improve the system efficiency and sustainability to benefit both the travellers and the operators.  I have utilized optimisation and control theory in the modelling and analysis of rail and road systems as well as their operation, management and control.

<!-- For openings of PhDs, Research Associates and Postdocs, please see the <a href="openings"> Openings </a> page. -->

### Research Interest

- Transportation network modeling, management and optimization
- Day-to-day traffic flow dynamics
- Smart and sustainable transportation
  - Autonomous vehicle: eco-routing, eco-driving
  - Railway: scheduling, eco-driving, automatic train operation
- AI for optimization (learning to optimize)

<!-- - Railway operation and control
# - Eco-driving (trains and cars) -->
